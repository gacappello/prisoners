# 100 PRISONERS

This is a simple implementation of the **100 Prisoners** problem written in C.

## A BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The idea of this example came from a video of [***Veritasium***](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium). <br/>

The video I'm talking about is [***this***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA&t=2s). <br/>

The main thing I wanted to do, was to prove that the percentage of winning this riddle is really **ln2**.

**AND IT ACTUALLY IS!!**

# INSTALLATION

This simple program can be installed on Linux

## LINUX

To install it on Linux, run these commands:
```
$ cd src
$ make
$ ./prisoners
```

## WINDOWS

Probably you need to install something link MinGW or WSL to compile this! <br/>
But once you have what you need, you won't have any problems!
